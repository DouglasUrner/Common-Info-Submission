##  Submitting Assignments

There are two common ways that you will be submitting assignments:

1. As a PDF of a Google Docs template that is linked from the assignment in Canvas.
1. As a **bookmarked** page in your design notebook.

Both are fairly simple processes but it is important to read the instructions on Canvas carefully and to follow the precisely.

## Submitting a PDF from a Google Docs template

1. Start by making opening the template and making an editable copy of it:
   - Right-click on the **submission template** link in the assignment - this will open the template as a **view only** document in a new tab.
   - From the File menu in Google Docs choose **Make a copy...** - this makes it editable.
   - Rename the document.
1. Following the instructions in the left-hand column of the document, complete the template:
   - When including links type a space after pasting the link into the template - this makes the link active (clickable).
   - If you are asked for a link to a Game Lab or App Lab project or to a Code.org assignment be sure that you use the **Share** button - otherwise the link will not let me see your work and you will need to resubmit.
   - If you need a refresher on making screen captures - [look here](https://douglasurner.github.io/Common-Info-Screen-Captures/) - as usual, right-click to open in a new tab.
1. Submit your completed template by:
   - Clicking on the blue **Submit** button in Canvas.
   - In the resulting document picker, choose the **Google Docs** tab.
   - Select your completed template - it will probably be the document closest to the top, right below the list of folders.
   - Click on the blue **Submit** button in the document picker.
1. Verify that Canvas now shows the assignment as submitted (you will also see that the Submit button has changed to **Resubmit.**

## Submitting a notebook page

1. Check the assignment to see what page you should be bookmarking.
1. Use a sticky note to bookmark the requested page, please place the bookmark at the top of the page.
1. Turn in your notebook as usual.
